<h4>Selective Repeat and Alternating-bit</h4>
<p>
 The purpose of these programs was to create a reliable data transfer over UDP's unreliable service. So, to enable this, I used two different implementations: Selective Repeat and Alternating-bit. The client.py script will request a file from server.py. In the event that server.py does get passed a valid file, it will then begin to transfer over the file using the Application layer reliable data transfer.
</p>
<h4>How to run</h4>
<p>
To run these programs, first run the server.py and then run client.py.The client.py script will prompt you to enter in a name of a file, so type in a name of that file you would wish to request from the server.
